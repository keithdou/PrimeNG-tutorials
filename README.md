# PrimeNgDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

# Setup

Install the latest versions of Node.js and npm for your platform. Whilst Node.js also installs npm, it is unlikely to be the latest version, so you should re-install npm with:

npm install -g npm@latest

Install the mock json server:

npm install -g json-server

cd to the root directoru of the project.  Install the node_modules and primeng:

npm install

npm install primeng

You should now be good to go.  Startup the mock json server:

json-server --watch mock.json

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
